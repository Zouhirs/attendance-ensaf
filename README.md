# Attendance ENSAF
This is an application that controls attendance of students using fingerprint, and a part of my Last Year's Project PFA (2020).
(This is a beta version, dedicated just to the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez, Morocco, 2019-2020 Embedded Systems stream 4th year. I will try to universalize it in the future.)
